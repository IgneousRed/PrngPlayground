How do computers make random numbers?
Computers are deterministic machines. 1 + 2 = 3.
If they are somehow not deterministic, we deem them broken.
Given the same state, the computer will always arive at the same result.
If so is true, does that mean computers can't generate random numbers?
Well, Yes, and No.
There are 2 general categories of Random: True Random and Pseudo Random.
True random can only be achieved by reaching outside the deterministic computer.
Since the outside world is chaotically complex with an extremely large state that is never the same
By using some kind of sensor to read the outside world, we can get True Randomness.
As opposed to every other goal, we want to separate the sensor signal from the noise,
here we want to do the opposite, we are ONLY interested in noise.
We could measure termal noise, radio noise, radioactive decay, and so on.
Many such methods are asymmetric and systematically biased.
Meaning that they produce non-uniform randomness.
Some outputs are over represented while others under represented.
That is why it is common to do some post-processing to correct non-uniformity.
So, if we need a truly random number
